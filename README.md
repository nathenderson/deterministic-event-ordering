# Deterministic Event Ordering

## Status
Scaffolded. CI configured. Implementation pending.

## Purpose
Explore deterministic, rule-based ordering of distributed events under:
- clock skew
- late arrival
- partial observability

## Current Implementation
- Repository structure established
- CI (ruff, black, pytest) configured
- Smoke test present

## Not Yet Implemented
- Event ordering engine
- Clock skew modeling
- Tie-breaking rules
- Deterministic ordering proofs

## Engineering Principles
- Determinism over heuristics
- Explicit assumptions
- Reproducibility
- Failure visibility

## Scope
Research + engineering prototype. Not production software.
